# Todo-List
Today I will be creating an application call Todo-List I'll be using Quasar to make sure it runs on all devices including mobile, Vue.js , VueX and Firebase 

What is Quasar?
Quasar (pronounced /ˈkweɪ.zɑɹ/) is an MIT licensed open-source Vue.js based framework, which allows you as a web developer to quickly create responsive++ websites/apps in many flavours:

SPAs (Single Page App)
SSR (Server-side Rendered App) (+ optional PWA client takeover)
PWAs (Progressive Web App)
Mobile Apps (Android, iOS, …) through Cordova or Capacitor
Multi-platform Desktop Apps (using Electron)
Quasar’s motto is: write code once and simultaneously deploy it as a website, a Mobile App and/or an Electron App. Yes, one codebase for all of them, helping you develop an app in record time by using a state of the art CLI and backed by best-practice, blazing fast Quasar web components.

When using Quasar, you won’t need additional heavy libraries like Hammerjs, Momentjs or Bootstrap. It’s got those needs covered internally, and all with a small footprint!

Create with quasar cli --- 
  install Nodejs
  sudo npm install -g @quasar/cli
  quasar create <FolderName>
  answer questions set up NPM, choose CSS processor and also name your project
  cd Project Name
  quasar dev
